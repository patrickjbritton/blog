> Watching from below, sinking undertoe.

The tower in the sky.
The wicked watching from high rising, the kings snidding.
Watching from below, sinking undertoe.
Furthest from the crushing tides.
Closest to the golden sky.

<!--more-->


Far from the dirty and meek.<br>
Finding glory in crushing the weak.<br>
The ones with the crown,<br>
always controlling the crowd.<br>

Keep yourselves together,<br>
Prepare for the bad weather.<br>
We no longer rise to defend,<br>
We only rise to pay the rent.<br>

We drag the stones,<br>
Ache in our bones,<br>
As they drink from silver on thrones.<br>
We find little shelter from the drones.<br>

We are but the flea,<br>
flung from the knee.<br>
We are but the wretched,<br>
Churning among the wicked.
