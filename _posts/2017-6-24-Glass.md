> It's easy to claim perfection.

It's easy to claim perfection.
To pretend all is perfect.
We ask how we are,
Yet we lie to each other.

The secret isn't very inclusive.
The world is anything but put-together.
Inside our homes there is a pressure leaking.
Always threatening to escape.

We find comfort in our denial.
We truly believe it ourselves.
On the outside we glow a fake suntan orange.
The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.

There is no shame in the dirt on our flesh.
The stress that drains from our eyes,
Or the blood on our tongues.
There is little to apologize for.

The best advice is to ignore the guilt.
We are but fragile glass on the shelf.
Sitting among our neighbors.
Pretending we do not hear.

For whatever it's worth the journey has a purpose.
There is always an end to the trail.
We can continue to disguise our sorrow.
Or we can embrace each other in the rain.
