> It's easy to claim perfection.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
To pretend all is perfect.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
We ask how we are,
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
Yet we lie to each other.

> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
The secret isn't very inclusive.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
The world is anything but put-together.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
Inside our homes there is a pressure leaking.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
Always threatening to escape.

> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
We find comfort in our denial.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
We truly believe it ourselves.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.
On the outside we glow a fake suntan orange.
> The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.

> There is no shame in the dirt on our flesh.
> The stress that drains from our eyes,
> Or the blood on our tongues.
> There is little to apologize for.

> The best advice is to ignore the guilt.
> We are but fragile glass on the shelf.
> Sitting among our neighbors.
> Pretending we do not hear.

> For whatever it's worth the journey has a purpose.
> There is always an end to the trail.
> We can continue to disguise our sorrow.
> Or we can embrace each other in the rain.
